# This repository contains solutions for Exercise 3, focusing on exploratory data analysis and regression modeling:

# Exercise 3.1: Advertising dataset

- Load and clean data

- Correlation heatmap of predictors vs. sales

- Simple OLS regressions for the most impactful predictors (TV and radio) with slope, t, p, R²

- Scatter plots with fitted regression lines

# Exercise 3.2: Diabetes dataset (from sklearn.datasets)

- Load dataset into a DataFrame

- Correlation heatmap of predictors vs. disease progression target

- Identify top 2 impactful predictors (e.g., BMI and s5)

- Simple OLS regressions with slope, t, p, R²

- Scatter plots with fitted regression lines

The analysis demonstrates how correlation helps identify impactful features and how simple linear regression quantifies their effect on the target variable.
